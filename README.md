## Hello everyone, let me introduce myself!
### **My name is** *Inny.* 
**Have you ever seen my name before?** **I haven't, so I'am satisfied with it**
- The name Inny is from the last letter of my Korean name '임정인'. As a nickname my dad called me '인아 인이야' and that became my English name
---
### **I would like to tell you what I am interested in nowadays.**
- I have divided it into two sections:
  **Music, OTT Series**
---
**1. MUSIC**
: [Get A Guitar by RIIZE](https://youtu.be/iUw3LPM7OBU?si=HITr6P_ZbxT2BanU)
---
- I am into this music for about 6 months. I listen to it everyday but I can't get sick of it. The funky beat and the sound of electric guitars fits my music taste.
- I am practicing to play the main sound on guitar, and I also want to learn the choreography.........if I can....

**2. OTT Series: ハイキュー!!**

- This is my favorite animation. I have already watched all seasons, but I need many Japanese inputs now. That's why I'm going through again.
- The storyline and the world view are amazing. All the characters and teams have their own story. 
- Game scenes are very detailed and dramatic; it makes me thrilled.
- Most of all, there are many great lines. One my favorite is:
  >才能は開花されるもの、センスは磨くもの。
